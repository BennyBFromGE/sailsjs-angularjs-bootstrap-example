**Notes** *(as of Jan 7, 2014)*

Be wary, this repo has been hacked together over a weekend as a Sails.js/AngularJS learning project.
Do not consider it as production-ready code.

The REST API example page (see `assets/linker/js/controllers/restCtrl.js`)
tries to exercise the error handling between HTTP and Socket modes.
I am currently seeing some odd behavior in HTTP mode when throwing application errors,
and in Socket mode when handling of forbidden errors. More research is needed.

The Todo app was written to explore how the socket.io connection, comet messages, and auto-subscriptions
work in Sails (see `assets/linker/js/controllers/todoCtrl.js`).
The Sails socket.io code was refactored into an Angular service (see `assets/linker/js/angular-sails.io.js`).
The custom retry logic first sends a `$http.get()` request to the server for obtaining the security token cookie,
otherwise you can encounter the `500 error: "handshake error"`
(See bottom of [FAQ](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/sockets) page).

If you stop the server or cause a network disconnect when on the example pages, you should see
some alert modals pop up.
These are managed by SailsSocketCtrl (see `assets/linker/js/controllers/sailsSocketCtrl.js`)
for reuse in other examples.

The Sails.js asset grunt tasks have been reconfigured to allow Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome custom compiles
(see `/assets/linker/styles/*.less`).
The grunt `copy` task has also been reconfigured to include other Bower-managed client-side libraries.

The [levid/angular-sails-socketio-mongo-demo](https://github.com/levid/angular-sails-socketio-mongo-demo) repo
may also be of interest for Angular/Sails integration, though it uses Sails v0.8.
